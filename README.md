# 🎥 video-translator

An Open Source Python library initially designed to **translate subtitles/captions from live video streams**, especially those from the **AKB48 Group Live Showroom**.

> **Note:** While originally built for Showroom translations, this library is designed to be **flexible** and can be adapted for translating subtitles from **various video sources**.

-----

## ✨ Features

  * **Live Translation:** Translate incoming subtitles/captions in real-time.
  * **Showroom Integration:** Specific modules/scripts to interface with the Showroom platform's caption system (or similar streaming sites).
  * **Customizable Translators:** Support for various translation APIs (e.g., Google Translate, DeepL, etc.) via a plug-in architecture.
  * **Output Flexibility:** Display translations in a new window, overlay on the video (where supported), or save to a file (e.g., `.srt`).
  * **Caching:** Optional caching of previously translated phrases to reduce API calls and latency.

-----

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

  * Python 3.8 or higher.
